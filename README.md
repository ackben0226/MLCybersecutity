## Project Description
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to cybersecurity, focusing on network traffic classification for intrusion detection. It compares supervised learning models like Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Decision Trees (DT), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) across benchmark datasets such as CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15. The research aims to enhance threat detection accuracy, minimize false positives, and optimize resource use in cybersecurity operations.
## Features
- Supervised Learning Models: Implementation of multiple models (RF, XGB, DT, SVM) to detect cyber threats in network traffic.
- Comparative Analysis: Model performance comparison based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Data Preprocessing: Techniques like handling missing values, outlier mitigation, and feature scaling.
- Evaluation Metrics: Use of precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for performance analysis.

## Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest (RF): A versatile model that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
- XGBoost (XGB): A gradient boosting framework used for more efficient and faster learning.
- Decision Trees (DT): A model that splits the data into subsets based on the most significant features.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): A robust classifier using hyperplanes to separate different classes.
## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the modelâ€™s predictions.
- Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations.
- Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
- F1-Score: A weighted average of precision and recall.
- ROC-AUC: Measures the performance of classification models at various threshold settings.
